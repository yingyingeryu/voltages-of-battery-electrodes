# Voltages of battery electrodes
Using the CGCNN transfer learning model to predict the voltages of Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Zn, Y, and Al-ion battery electrodes

The package provides all the files that are used in the article of "Accurately predicting voltage of electrode materials in metal-ion batteries using interpretable
 deep transfer learning"
 
 The CGCNN model is provided by Xie Tian et.al (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.145301). They also provide their model in github (http://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn).

##  Prerequisites

This package requires:

- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org)
- [numpy](http://numpy.org/)

If you are new to Python, the easiest way of installing the prerequisites is via [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html). After installing [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/), run the following command to create a new [environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) named `cgcnn` and install all prerequisites.

## Files introduction
- CGCNN folder

The files in this folder are just the same as the corresponding files in the CGCNN model that Xie Tian et.al give (http://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn).

We used files in this folder to train the model for the voltage prediction of Li-ion battery electrodes.

- CGCNN_visualization

The files in this folder are used to have a visualization of the CGCNN model. 

The embedding_features.py is to visualize the features from the embedding layer in the CGCNN model.

The local_voltage_plt.py is to visualize the local voltages, which are obtained after the three convolutional layers.

The element_features.csv and OMO_local.csv are the data files that are used in the embedding_features.py and local_voltage_plt.py respectively. 
The element_features_csv.py and OMO_local_csv.py are the corresponding codes to get the two csv data files. 

The other files in this folder are the useful files in the embedding_features.py and the local_voltage_plt.py. 
- Transfer_learning

The files in this folder are the main file for the model training for the prediction of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Zn, Y, and Al-ion battery electrods voltages respectively.
- Trained_model

Here are the trained models for the voltage predictions of the corresponding metal-ion battery electrodes.

The model_best.pth file is trained on Li-ion battery electrodes dataset. It can be used for the Li-ion battery electrode voltage prediction. 
It also used to predict the voltages for the Rb and Cs-ion battery electrodes.

The model_best_Na.pth file is trained on Na-ion battery electrodes dataset and also used for the Na-ion battery electrode voltage prediction.

The model_best_K.pth file is trained on K-ion battery electrodes dataset and also used for the K-ion battery electrode voltage prediction.

The model_best_Mg.pth file is trained on Mg-ion battery electrodes dataset and also used for the Mg-ion battery electrode voltage prediction.

The model_best_Ca.pth file is trained on Ca-ion battery electrodes dataset and also used for the Ca-ion battery electrode voltage prediction.

The model_best_Zn.pth file is trained on Zn-ion battery electrodes dataset and also used for the Zn-ion battery electrode voltage prediction.

The model_best_Y.pth file is trained on Y-ion battery electrodes dataset and also used for the Y-ion battery electrode voltage prediction.

The model_best_Al.pth file is trained on Al-ion battery electrodes dataset and also used for the Al-ion battery electrode voltage prediction.

- data

This folder contains the required data for the model training and the corresponding code to get these data files.
- SVR_KRR_RFR

Here are the SVR (Supporting Vector Regression), KRR (Kernel Ridge Regression), and RFR (Random Forest Regression) models that are used in our work. 

## Web-tool
A convenient web tool has been built for the voltage prediction of all the metal-ion battery electrodes.
